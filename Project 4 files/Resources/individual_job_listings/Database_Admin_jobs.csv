At Glassdoor we apply a ""tier"" system to promote consistency in level of compensation for where roles are filled in different locations. The tiers are as follows:

Tier 1 encompasses the highest salary range for states where large metropolitan areas are located (ie: San Francisco, New York City, Washington DC, & etc)
Tier 2 encompasses salary ranges 15% less than those in Tier 1 for states with mid-sized cities (ie: Chicago, Dallas, Portland, etc)
Tier 3 encompasses salary ranges 20% less than those in Tier 1 for states with smaller
cities (including our Ohio office, Nevada, etc)
