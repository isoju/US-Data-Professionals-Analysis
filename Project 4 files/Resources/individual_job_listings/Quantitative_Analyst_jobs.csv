Cogo Labs Leadership Principles

1. Take Big Swings

Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders strive to spend their time exclusively on what's important, and they shed the rest. They seek out the highest return on their team's time and effort.

2. Data Driven

Leaders work backwards from the solution to generate plans. They use data to be sure their time and effort are always leveraged at the most impactful work. They admit when they are wrong and use the data to eliminate their blind spots.

3. Make Moonshine

Leaders create value from spare and under-utilized parts. They're resourceful and tenacious. They expect and require innovation and invention from their teams, and they find ways to simplify. They are situationally aware; they look for good ideas from anywhere.

4. Insist on the Highest Standards

Leaders keep the standards relentlessly high. They demand high quality products, services, and processes because they deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders solve root problems and ensure that when problems get fixed, they stay fixed.

5. Bias for Action

Leaders run everywhere they go. Many decisions and actions are reversible and don't need extensive study. Leaders value calculated risk taking because they know that in business, speed wins.

6. Have Integrity; Earn Trust

Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is difficult or embarrassing. Leaders are not arrogant. They benchmark themselves against the best and identify their gaps.

7. Hire and Develop the Best

Leaders raise the bar with every hire and promotion. They want to work with other leaders. They recognize exceptional talent and enthusiastically propel them throughout the organization. Leaders are serious about their role in coaching others.

8. Ownership

Leaders think long-term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They own all the inputs to their business. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.

9. Disagree and Commit

Leaders respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or awkward. They have conviction; they do not compromise in the name of social niceties. Once a decision is reached, they commit wholly.

10. Dive Deep

Leaders operate at once with immense perspective and granular detail. No task is beneath them. They audit frequently, and they are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ.

11. Deliver Results

Leaders focus their time on the key drivers for their business. They pursue them obsessively to deliver results with the right quality and in a timely fashion. They rise to the occasion and never compromise.",https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=1958c3e9387c6277&fccid=c9e769ff6bc13ee9&vjs=3

Together, we remain committed to the fight for a healthy climate built on a foundation of environmental, racial, economic, and gender justice – a future where all people benefit from a healthy, thriving planet and a direct connection to nature. As the climate crisis and deeply entrenched systemic racism all fuel inequity, we will continue to fight for a bold, transformational agenda that recognizes the interconnectedness between our planet, our humanity, and our democracy. By recognizing that our destinies are tied, we continue to name that all things are fundamentally connected, and the overlap between ecology, race, gender, and representative government will move to either advance our collective humanity or to oppress it.Sierra Club is comprised of staff across the country and a network of local chapters that support our grassroots engagement. We are also proud to be a unionized employer, with two labor unions representing more than half of our employees.Scope: The Energy Campaigns Analyst is an integral part of a team working across Sierra Club’s campaigns to transform the U.S. energy sector off fossil fuels and towards an equitable clean energy future. They will be responsible for providing strategic research and analysis to strengthen our advocacy in two primary areas: 1) light and heavy-duty vehicle electrification, and 2) liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facilities. They will work with the Director of Research, Strategy and Analysis to determine if these campaigns are on track to meet goals and disseminate findings both internally and externally. They will work closely with the Sierra Club’s Analyst Team to develop cross-cutting research across sectors to determine vulnerabilities in the fossil fuel industry.

In order to avert the worst impacts of the climate crisis, we must ensure that we slow or stop the expansion of fossil fuel production at the same time as we are bringing down emissions. Sierra Club’s Beyond Dirty Fuels Campaign is driving externalized costs into the production of gas, stopping new bulk gas pipelines and related infrastructure, and blocking the expansion of LNG export facilities. At the same time, we leverage these fights to galvanize a vibrant, diverse climate justice movement, powerful enough to erode the social license of all fossil fuels. The Energy Campaigns Analyst will design and carry out research and analysis to assess strategic priorities for our advocacy; assess economic vulnerabilities in LNG proposals; analyze operations and emissions of existing LNG facilities; expand our understanding of connections between proposed LNG facilities and pipelines; research connections to LNG financing and connections to our international work; provide insights on LNG policy mechanisms and the interplay with oil & gas markets and regulations; support campaign leadership with review of industry trends, news and studies.Assist with fundraising.

Cogo Labs Leadership Principles

1. Take Big Swings

Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders strive to spend their time exclusively on what's important, and they shed the rest. They seek out the highest return on their team's time and effort.

2. Data Driven

Leaders work backwards from the solution to generate plans. They use data to be sure their time and effort are always leveraged at the most impactful work. They admit when they are wrong and use the data to eliminate their blind spots.

3. Make Moonshine

Leaders create value from spare and under-utilized parts. They're resourceful and tenacious. They expect and require innovation and invention from their teams, and they find ways to simplify. They are situationally aware; they look for good ideas from anywhere.

4. Insist on the Highest Standards

Leaders keep the standards relentlessly high. They demand high quality products, services, and processes because they deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders solve root problems and ensure that when problems get fixed, they stay fixed.

5. Bias for Action

Leaders run everywhere they go. Many decisions and actions are reversible and don't need extensive study. Leaders value calculated risk taking because they know that in business, speed wins.

6. Have Integrity; Earn Trust

Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is difficult or embarrassing. Leaders are not arrogant. They benchmark themselves against the best and identify their gaps.

7. Hire and Develop the Best

Leaders raise the bar with every hire and promotion. They want to work with other leaders. They recognize exceptional talent and enthusiastically propel them throughout the organization. Leaders are serious about their role in coaching others.

8. Ownership

Leaders think long-term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They own all the inputs to their business. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.

9. Disagree and Commit

Leaders respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or awkward. They have conviction; they do not compromise in the name of social niceties. Once a decision is reached, they commit wholly.

10. Dive Deep

Leaders operate at once with immense perspective and granular detail. No task is beneath them. They audit frequently, and they are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ.

11. Deliver Results

Leaders focus their time on the key drivers for their business. They pursue them obsessively to deliver results with the right quality and in a timely fashion. They rise to the occasion and never compromise.",https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=1958c3e9387c6277&fccid=c9e769ff6bc13ee9&vjs=3

Cogo Labs Leadership Principles

1. Take Big Swings

Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders strive to spend their time exclusively on what's important, and they shed the rest. They seek out the highest return on their team's time and effort.

2. Data Driven

Leaders work backwards from the solution to generate plans. They use data to be sure their time and effort are always leveraged at the most impactful work. They admit when they are wrong and use the data to eliminate their blind spots.

3. Make Moonshine

Leaders create value from spare and under-utilized parts. They're resourceful and tenacious. They expect and require innovation and invention from their teams, and they find ways to simplify. They are situationally aware; they look for good ideas from anywhere.

4. Insist on the Highest Standards

Leaders keep the standards relentlessly high. They demand high quality products, services, and processes because they deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders solve root problems and ensure that when problems get fixed, they stay fixed.

5. Bias for Action

Leaders run everywhere they go. Many decisions and actions are reversible and don't need extensive study. Leaders value calculated risk taking because they know that in business, speed wins.

6. Have Integrity; Earn Trust

Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is difficult or embarrassing. Leaders are not arrogant. They benchmark themselves against the best and identify their gaps.

7. Hire and Develop the Best

Leaders raise the bar with every hire and promotion. They want to work with other leaders. They recognize exceptional talent and enthusiastically propel them throughout the organization. Leaders are serious about their role in coaching others.

8. Ownership

Leaders think long-term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They own all the inputs to their business. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.

9. Disagree and Commit

Leaders respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or awkward. They have conviction; they do not compromise in the name of social niceties. Once a decision is reached, they commit wholly.

10. Dive Deep

Leaders operate at once with immense perspective and granular detail. No task is beneath them. They audit frequently, and they are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ.

11. Deliver Results

Leaders focus their time on the key drivers for their business. They pursue them obsessively to deliver results with the right quality and in a timely fashion. They rise to the occasion and never compromise.",https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=1958c3e9387c6277&fccid=c9e769ff6bc13ee9&vjs=3

The Vera Institute of Justice, founded in 1961, is a nonprofit criminal justice organization that strives to build just government institutions and safe communities free from the scourge of racism, white supremacy, profit, and inequity that is pervasive in this country’s legal systems. We are an “inside” lane organization that drives change at scale with ambitious public sector leaders who share our commitment to building anti-racist, reparative systems that deliver justice. We leverage our access to government to transform these systems and work collaboratively with stakeholders across many movements—including advocacy, grassroots, and grassroots organizations. Our role is to pilot solutions that are transformative and achievable, harness the power of evidence to drive effective policy and practice, and use advocacy and communications to change narratives and norms.
Vera has a staff of almost 300 people and offices in New York City, Washington, DC, Los Angeles, and New Orleans. We are an equal opportunity employer with a commitment to diversity in the workplace. We expect our staff to embody respect, independence, collaboration, commitment, anti-racism, and equity—both in our outward-facing work and the internal culture of our workplace. We value a range of experiences in people’s educational backgrounds and encourage people who have been directly impacted by the criminal justice system to apply.
Vera California:
We are looking for a Research Analyst to join our Vera California team. At a time of unprecedented attention on justice issues, Californians up and down the state are working to end the era of mass incarceration and address attacks on immigrant families. Vera California launched in 2018 to contribute to this movement. By building partnerships with reform-minded government officials and community-led coalitions—leveraging our national-level research, technical assistance, strategic communications, and local staff based on Los Angeles—we aim to end racial disparities and promote human dignity in the criminal and immigration legal systems.
Who you are
The Research Analyst will be passionate about social and racial justice, motivated to drive change, and unafraid to challenge the status quo. The idea of working on a team of people who come from diverse backgrounds and perspectives inspires you.

As a Research Analyst, you will work in close collaboration with the Vera California team to conduct and assist with a range of quantitative research projects on jail and prison incarceration, parole, sentencing, policy reforms, and public safety budgets that push for financial investments in community-based systems of care in California.

2. Communicate data findings
Turn data insights into easy-to-understand briefs, slide decks, and other written pieces for use by non-research staff, community advocates, government partners, and the public.
Explain data analyses to individuals who do not have a technical data background.
3. Engage with Partners
Attend local and state coalition calls and provide team updates.
4. Document your Work
Document your processes so that other research staff can replicate your results.
Provide code review for other research staff.
What qualifications do you need?
Required:
A deep commitment to racial equity and advancing anti-racism, both in our workplace and in the world. You incorporate this value, share it with others, and lead with these principles.
 Training in data analysis, research methods, and communicating research findings.
1+ years of experience in preparing and analyzing large datasets.
A solid foundation in R, Python, or another programming language used to manipulate data.
Exceptional attention to detail while staying aware of big-picture goals.
Strong problem-solving ability and logical reasoning skills, and the ability to detect anomalies in data.
An enthusiasm for the technical parts of working with data, talking with people who are affected by or represented in that data, and communicating findings to people who do not have a technical data background.
Ability to work on multiple projects effectively and efficiently in a fast-paced environment.
You must be curious and willing to research, read, and learn continuously, and willing and able to provide your perspective on issues about which you have expertise.
Preferred:
Lived experience as a person directly impacted by the criminal-legal system
Knowledge of California’s criminal-legal system
Experience writing scripts that scrape HTML and PDFs

We are an “inside” lane organization that drives change at scale with ambitious public sector leaders who share our commitment to building anti-racist, reparative systems that deliver justice. We leverage our access to government to transform these systems and work collaboratively with stakeholders across many movements—including advocacy, grassroots, and grassroots organizations. Our role is to pilot solutions that are transformative and achievable, harness the power of evidence to drive effective policy and practice, and use advocacy and communications to change narratives and norms.

We expect our staff to embody respect, independence, collaboration, commitment, anti-racism, and equity—both in our outward-facing work and the internal culture of our workplace.

Vera California:
We are looking for a Research Analyst to join our Vera California team. At a time of unprecedented attention on justice issues, Californians up and down the state are working to end the era of mass incarceration and address attacks on immigrant families.

As a Research Analyst, you will work in close collaboration with the Vera California team to conduct and assist with a range of quantitative research projects on jail and prison incarceration, parole, sentencing, policy reforms, and public safety budgets that push for financial investments in community-based systems of care in California.

You will report to the California Research Associate and receive support from Vera’s robust research department. This is a full-time position based in California; Los Angeles preferred.

Explain data analyses to individuals who do not have a technical data background.
3. Engage with Partners
Attend local and state coalition calls and provide team updates.
4. Document your Work
Document your processes so that other research staff can replicate your results.
Provide code review for other research staff.
What qualifications do you need?

 Training in data analysis, research methods, and communicating research findings.
1+ years of experience in preparing and analyzing large datasets.
A solid foundation in R, Python, or another programming language used to manipulate data.
Exceptional attention to detail while staying aware of big-picture goals.

UW employees offer their boundless energy, creative problem solving skills and dedication to build stronger minds and a healthier world.


UW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty.


The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) is an independent research center at the University of Washington. Its mission is to deliver to the world timely, relevant, and scientifically valid evidence to improve health policy and practice. IHME carries out its mission through a range of projects within different research areas including the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors; Future Health Scenarios; Cost Effectiveness and Efficiency; Resource Tracking; and Impact Evaluations. Our vision is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base so all people live long lives in full health.


IHME is committed to providing the evidence base necessary to help solve the world’s most important health problems. This requires creativity and innovation, which is cultivated by an inclusive, diverse, and equitable environment that respects and appreciates differences, embraces collaboration, and invites the voices of all IHME team members.


IHME has an outstanding opportunity for a Data Extraction Analyst to join the BIRDS (Brain/Back pain and other MSKs, Injuries, Respiratory/Renal, Drugs/Diabetes, and Sensory) team. Our team makes estimates for the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) Study, which is a systematic, scientific effort to quantify the comparative magnitude of health loss due to diseases, injuries, and risk factors by age, sex, and geography over time. It is the largest and most comprehensive effort to date to measure epidemiological levels and trends worldwide. This position will be responsible for data extraction tasks related to supporting “Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias” modeling for the GBD and innovative and exploratory projects to further methods development funded by Gates Ventures.


The main purpose of this position is to provide highly specialized oversight and guidance of routine but complex extraction processes for input data used in modeling, papers and presentations at IHME.

Vera California:
We are looking for a Research Analyst to join our Vera California team. At a time of unprecedented attention on justice issues, Californians up and down the state are working to end the era of mass incarceration and address attacks on immigrant families. Vera California launched in 2018 to contribute to this movement. By building partnerships with reform-minded government officials and community-led coalitions—leveraging our national-level research, technical assistance, strategic communications, and local staff based on Los Angeles—we aim to end racial disparities and promote human dignity in the criminal and immigration legal systems.
Who you are
The Research Analyst will be passionate about social and racial justice, motivated to drive change, and unafraid to challenge the status quo. The idea of working on a team of people who come from diverse backgrounds and perspectives inspires you. You care deeply about racial equity—in your research, your work, with your colleagues, and around the office. As a Research Analyst, you will work in close collaboration with the Vera California team to conduct and assist with a range of quantitative research projects on jail and prison incarceration, parole, sentencing, policy reforms, and public safety budgets that push for financial investments in community-based systems of care in California. You will also support the analytics needs of local and state campaigns working to center care first as a practice and policy rather than incarceration. You will report to the California Research Associate and receive support from Vera’s robust research department. This is a full-time position based in California; Los Angeles preferred.
In this role, you will:
1. Prepare and analyze data
Find and collect data from a variety of sources: open data portals. Public Records Act / FOIA requests, GitHub, data received from community- and government-partners, etc.
Prepare large datasets for analysis, including merging, cleaning, and recording data.
Conduct data analyses that often include creative data visualization and dashboarding.
2. Communicate data findings
Turn data insights into easy-to-understand briefs, slide decks, and other written pieces for use by non-research staff, community advocates, government partners, and the public.
Explain data analyses to individuals who do not have a technical data background.
3. Engage with Partners
Attend local and state coalition calls and provide team updates.
4. Document your Work
Document your processes so that other research staff can replicate your results.
Provide code review for other research staff.
What qualifications do you need?
Required:
A deep commitment to racial equity and advancing anti-racism, both in our workplace and in the world. You incorporate this value, share it with others, and lead with these principles.
 Training in data analysis, research methods, and communicating research findings.
1+ years of experience in preparing and analyzing large datasets.
A solid foundation in R, Python, or another programming language used to manipulate data.
Exceptional attention to detail while staying aware of big-picture goals.
Strong problem-solving ability and logical reasoning skills, and the ability to detect anomalies in data.
An enthusiasm for the technical parts of working with data, talking with people who are affected by or represented in that data, and communicating findings to people who do not have a technical data background.
Ability to work on multiple projects effectively and efficiently in a fast-paced environment.
You must be curious and willing to research, read, and learn continuously, and willing and able to provide your perspective on issues about which you have expertise.
Preferred:
Lived experience as a person directly impacted by the criminal-legal system
Knowledge of California’s criminal-legal system
Experience writing scripts that scrape HTML and PDFs
Ability to create interactive data visualizations with programs like Tableau, Power BI, Datawrapper, Google Data Studio, Shiny, or similar programs

Founding Equity Analyst,StockStory,Remote,,"Remote
Full-time
StockStory is looking for a founding equity analyst to join our team and help us build a new generation of stock investment advice, democratizing access to analytical methods, data and technology that was until now only reserved for top hedge funds.
Retail investing is going through a massive boom and retail focused investment research is a big market, but technologically about 20 years behind the rest of the industry. It is still mainly email newsletters and Wordpress sites. It is manual, slow, expensive and often poor quality.

Do you feel passionate about changing that? Read on!

At StockStory we algorithmically generate articles that provide high quality, fact-based, data-driven investment advice at scale. Our purpose is to make profitable long-term investing easier for as many individual investors as possible and we do it by giving them exactly the answers they need, not some figure-it-out-yourself research tools.
We have a distribution partnership with Apple and our analysis is now by default present in every iPhone in the US through the native Stocks app, alongside companies like Reuters, CNBC or The Street. The response has been overwhelmingly great.

You can get a small taste of what is coming by following our earnings coverage of the tech sector. We built a proprietary AI technology to provide investors with the fastest analysis of earnings results on the market. You will know what decision to make faster than almost any other investor, including professional fund managers.
To see few early examples check out our recent articles or our Apple News channel.

But that is just a beginning.

We have a lot of really interesting problems to solve and need somebody who is as excited about them as we are. Is that you? Come and join us.

About the role:

This is an opportunity to join an early stage, VC funded startup as the first analyst hire and have a massive impact on the product and the company itself. We are currently still only a small team of three, you will have a very meaningful equity in the company and there is an opportunity for you to become a late co-founder in the company.

We prefer excited fast learners with less experience over decades of experience and no drive. You will be working with a team that has previously built successful AI products in the finance and cybersecurity space.
This role will be a great fit for you if:

You have a passion for long-term, growth-oriented investing
You enjoy working with data, finding analytical insights in them and can at least build a quantitative analysis model in a spreadsheet
You have a strong knowledge of financial statements, and understand different valuation techniques
You are deeply interested in the US tech sector, we are currently focusing on covering public software companies (you will get to learn about a lot of them)
You love telling captivating stories, you enjoy writing for the general investing public and do it well
You have the ability to communicate complex ideas in an easy to understand way and synthesize financial and business aspects of a company

What we would like to see from you:

A private or public investing track record that proves you are a good investor
2+ years of experience in equity research (can be self-published), investment banking, VC or a related field
At least basic ability to work with data (spreadsheet modeling or SQL) and write very simple code (Python, R, JS or any other programming language)
A university degree in Economics, Finance, MBA or CFA a plus, but not necessary

Location:

Ideally US Eastern timezone (New York) or Western/Central European time zones. Due to Covid we are currently fully remote with team members based in Sydney, Australia and Prague, Czech Republic.

How to apply:

Send us a 500 word research pitch for a stock that you believe we should invest in today, CV and a cover letter to adam (at) stockstory.org

I will personally review every application and answer to everybody.
