We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

They may prepare reports and presentations, as well as demonstrations, to keep the users informed about issues that arise during development and report on integration and deployment. They may also receive updated specifications and requirements from users throughout the development lifecycle.
Manage External Vendors - For many projects, solution architects work with outside vendors to develop and implement specific aspects of the software solution.

This role requires attention to detail, as the solution architect frequently needs to examine functional specifications and translate them into system guidelines that shape delivery as well as find ways to align projects with enterprise-level systems.
In addition to guiding development teams, a solution architect is frequently responsible for conducting research on existing systems and devising integration strategies that work within those solution sets. They collaborate directly with business units to review proposed new solutions, assess and address concerns regarding software capabilities and requirements, and work to resolve issues that arise during the development and deployment phases
Duties and Responsibilities:
Attain Functional Requirements - Initial duties of this role within the application development lifecycle is to gather requirements and functional specifications from users. This aspect of the role may require working closely with business unit leaders and team members to gain a complete sense of expectations, challenges, and specifications before formulating a scope for a development project. As part of this process, the solution architect may examine existing systems, process and programs to identify areas for improvement and opportunities for integration and potential automation.
Develop Specifications - Solution architect uses their functional requirements and existing systems to develop delivery specifications. They may develop schedules and test plans, prepare documentation based on analyst reports, and assemble documents presenting project guidelines and milestones to team members. At the same time, solution architects may identify potential issues between systems, proposed integration, and specifications and propose new solutions to work around these challenges and address the limitations.
Determine Development and Integration Scope - A solution architect is also responsible for determining a scope before developers are able to provide requirements documents for approval and proceed with code. They may conduct testing, and research existing systems and configurations to determine whether added time and work is necessary to align the applications with enterprise-level systems. They also identify areas where implementation may require more solutions to be successful. Throughout this process, the solution architect communicates directly with business unit leaders, project team, and developers.
Lead Development Teams - Throughout the development lifecycle, a solution architect directs and oversees the activities of a team of developers, answering questions or helping to resolve issues as they arise. This aspect of the role requires the solution architect to ensure that specifications and requirements are clearly articulated to their development teams. They monitor timelines and progress to ensure that team members are adhering to these specifications. The solution architect also serves as a liaison between Business Units and developers.
Interface Directly with Business Units - From the initial conversations to determine project scope and specifications to the final presentation of software solutions, a solution architect meets directly with users to provide feedback and updates on development projects. They may prepare reports and presentations, as well as demonstrations, to keep the users informed about issues that arise during development and report on integration and deployment. They may also receive updated specifications and requirements from users throughout the development lifecycle.
Manage External Vendors - For many projects, solution architects work with outside vendors to develop and implement specific aspects of the software solution. This aspect of the role may require the solution architect to consider costs and timelines and ensure that vendors meet deadlines for deliverables and project elements. They may review proposals and estimates from these vendors and determine whether they fit into existing budgetary and time restrictions and ensure that external solutions work with internal development projects
