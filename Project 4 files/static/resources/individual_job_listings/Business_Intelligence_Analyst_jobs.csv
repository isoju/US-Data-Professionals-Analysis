Strategy and Analytics - Analyst (Remote Friendly),Mission Lane LLC,North Carolina•Remote,,"Mission Lane LLC is a fintech on a mission (no pun intended) to increase access to financial tools that help people thrive. We are raising the bar on fair credit access, easy money management, and convenient income discovery. Our philosophy is simple: when our customers do well, we do well. And we have only just begun.
The Credit Team is looking for a Sr. Business Analyst of Strategy and Analytics to drive forward our mission of financial inclusion. In this role you will help our customers succeed financially by unlocking access to credit and helping manage it well. We are based primarily in Richmond, VA and San Francisco, CA, and are open to considering remote candidates that would be open to travel to our offices on occasions.
The Impact You'll Make in this Role:

Given our customers have had challenges with credit, we start slow and set them up for success slowly.
Set up goals for customer success and lay down transparently how customers can achieve it.
Help make credit success a habit for customers.
Reward positive customer behavior by meeting their growing credit needs!
This is a mission critical role that is not only solving key customer problems but also generating a lot of business value.

To set you up for success in this role from day one, Mission Lane is looking for candidates who have:

Ability to lead the development and implementation of strategies that change the trajectory of the business and require collaboration with cross-functional teams.
1-2 years of experience in a highly analytical role (preferably in consumer lending).
Experience with hypothesis and frame work driven consumer analytics.
Bachelor's or Master's in Economics, Finance, Engineering, Mathematics, or similar quantitative field with record of strong academic performance.

You get bonus points for:

Experience helping scale a business in a fast-paced startup environment
Expertise in analytic and modeling tools (SQL, Python, etc.)

More about Mission Lane:

Mission Lane is based in the U.S., with offices in Richmond, Virginia & San Francisco, California. Founded in December 2018, we've rapidly grown to over 1 million customers.

It all started with a realization: nearly fifty percent of the adult population in the U.S. doesn't have access to a clear line of credit. And by ""clear"" we mean credit without crazy fees that only increase debt. Most traditional credit card companies either overlook or overcharge this group because they have less-than-prime credit scores or no score at all. We decided this just wouldn't do.

We understand that everyone doesn't have the same opportunities. We also know that everyone joins us at different stages of their financial journeys. Providing access to clear credit was a critical first step, but our work isn't done. We are actively developing new products designed to meet our customers where they are, according to their needs.

We get it - life happens. That's why Mission Lane is hard at work paving a better way forward.

Just like for our customers, Mission Lane creates opportunities for our employees to learn, grow, and prosper. We strive to create an environment that brings out the best in everyone, everyday.

Data Analyst | Revenue Operations (Remote),Process Street,Illinois•Remote,,"Who we are:

Process Street is a no-code workflow platform startup from San Francisco. We help our customers build, document, automate, and track recurring workflows. Our platform stores knowledge where the action happens, ensuring thorough and error free execution of workflows that our global customers run their businesses on.

We service over 3k customers around the world, such as Airbnb, Spotify, AstraZeneca and Accenture, and are VC-backed by Accel, Salesforce, and Atlassian.

Process Street was founded on a strong belief in the work-life benefits of a healthy, collaborative remote culture. We value flexibility because many of us are parents, travelers, or just creatives who aren't inspired by the construct of a mundane 9-to-5. Spread across 9 different time zones, we communicate asynchronously, work autonomously, and take real ownership of our work.

If you're entrepreneurial and seek an environment that values your effective creativity, congratulations, you've found your new home!


The Opportunity

You will be Process Street's first in-house data engineer and analyst, and your responsibilities will encompass all-things data! As the first data hire, you will initially report to the Director of Revenue Operations and will have the opportunity to shape our data strategy and architecture to take our data-driven decision-making to the next level. Although this will start as an IC role, you will have ownership and autonomy from day 1. With delivering business value and strong results, you can anticipate short-term leadership potential!


What you'll do:

Understand Process Street's business and redesign our company's data architecture to support our next generation of product and data initiatives.
Make architectural and tool decisions to implement real-time data systems.
Work with stakeholders across the business, including the leadership team to define strategic objectives, product direction, roadmaps, growth goals, retention strategies, etc.
Evangelize data analysis through storytelling and easy-to-consume reporting for business teams to act on.
Produce insights (e.g. performance drivers, retention analysis, behavioral personas) to help grow the business.
Monitor, clean, and maintain data for high performance.
Partner with the key cross-functional teams to optimize strategic decisions and build scalable tools (and dashboards) that assess the impact and improve decision-making.
Expand the data culture by growing new relationships, hosting learning sessions, and improving team processes.


What you bring to the table:

At least 4 years of experience in an analytical role with a minimum of one year with engineering responsibilities.
Advanced skills in SQL and experience working with data warehouses, including Snowflake.
Experience working at a B2B SaaS startup with self-serve and sales-led motions.
Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, or another quantitative field.


Our Benefits

Fully remote team – No offices, no commute, check-in from a destination of your choosing!
Unlimited PTO policy – Most take 3-4 weeks, plus their major holidays, AND a company-wide week off in December
Annual company offsite* (when not in a pandemic of course) In lieu of an offsite, we do encourage and sponsor small group meetups so that you can meet your teammates face to face around the world.
Social time – We know human connections are what make teams strong. We regularly do coffee chats, game-playing, story-telling, house tours (only if you're comfortable), and more to build connections.
Generous health insurance for US employees and their families
Equity for all full-time roles

More about Mission Lane:

Mission Lane is based in the U.S., with offices in Richmond, Virginia & San Francisco, California. Founded in December 2018, we've rapidly grown to over 1 million customers.

It all started with a realization: nearly fifty percent of the adult population in the U.S. doesn't have access to a clear line of credit. And by ""clear"" we mean credit without crazy fees that only increase debt. Most traditional credit card companies either overlook or overcharge this group because they have less-than-prime credit scores or no score at all. We decided this just wouldn't do.

We understand that everyone doesn't have the same opportunities. We also know that everyone joins us at different stages of their financial journeys. Providing access to clear credit was a critical first step, but our work isn't done. We are actively developing new products designed to meet our customers where they are, according to their needs.

We get it - life happens. That's why Mission Lane is hard at work paving a better way forward.

Just like for our customers, Mission Lane creates opportunities for our employees to learn, grow, and prosper. We strive to create an environment that brings out the best in everyone, everyday.

The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) is an independent research center at the University of Washington. Its mission is to deliver to the world timely, relevant, and scientifically valid evidence to improve health policy and practice. IHME carries out its mission through a range of projects within different research areas including the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors; Future Health Scenarios; Cost Effectiveness and Efficiency; Resource Tracking; and Impact Evaluations.
