We're always welcoming an expansion of this toolset, and we appreciate engineers that use their experience in other technologies to expand our horizons.

If you're the right candidate, you'll be exercising all the skills you have and building new ones along the way:

Solve interesting problems with code.
Build new features for internal and external users, and refactor existing ones to make them better.
Work with a wide range of systems, processes, and technologies to solve problems in sustainable ways. Sometimes you'll be neck-deep in low-level systems, and other times you'll be pairing up with the front-end team on the user interface.

Education. Generally, a bachelor's degree is really helpful in working with our team on this kind of work. But feel free to convince us if you're the exception.
An insatiable intellectual curiosity and the ability to learn quickly in a complex space

Benefits

For the right candidate, we'll offer a competitive salary plus equity. Your compensation is rounded out by a strong benefits package:

Flexible work hours, with work-from-home options available for many roles
Three weeks of paid leave per year, an additional two weeks of sick time, plus extended holidays and team-approved leave
Ten days of 100% subsidized childcare per year
Healthcare, vision, and dental insurance plans (HMO or PPO), with voluntary add-ons available for dependent care, life, and accident coverage
Commuter benefit available for public transit or parking

Most importantly, you'll be doing important work with a team of people you'll genuinely enjoy spending the day with.

Software Engineer: Embedded Systems,Oxide Computer Company,Remote,"$180,250 a year","The rack-scale computer is loaded with essential embedded systems, responsible for the many unseen components that support the operation of a rack-scale computer.
As a software engineer working on embedded systems software, you will:
Work with a friendly and positive team to write the low-level code that makes Oxide computers tick.
Write code mostly in Rust, read code primarily written in Rust and C. The vast majority of code you write will be open source (maybe all of it!), and we are not starting with existing vendor code – we’re trying to do things right.
Write programs that interact with the physical world, from blinking lights to rack-level thermal control systems to supporting hot-swap of server components.
Read datasheets for relevant sensors, microcontrollers, etc., and implement drivers for them in bare-metal and embedded RTOS environments.
Drive our device security by extending the verified boot chain from first instruction to the control plane running on Oxide systems. You’ll secure the interface among lowest level components and into the control plane, build identity and access control, and work with the team to define and defend against threats.
Code without fear, supported by continuous builds, unit testing, memory-safe code, good debugging tools, a constructive code-review process, and a supportive culture of identifying and fixing bugs.
These responsibilities are just a starting place! We’re a small company, we don’t have rigid roles, and we have a lot to do – we can help you grow wherever your interests take you.
You will thrive in this role if you:
Have previously worked with Rust or another low-level systems language such as C.
Have worked with microcontrollers, whether it’s at a job or some kind of Arduino pet-washing coffee maker.
Believe in fully documenting your ideas.
Enjoy reading the documentation produced by others.
Get excited about things and dig really deep into them.
Are very comfortable at a Unix terminal.
Don’t mind coworkers getting really excited about decades-old computer front panels.
If you don’t meet 100% of these qualifications you should still seriously consider applying – at least one of us was missing each of these at the outset!
Life at Oxide
We are very explicit about our values, and they can be seen in daily life at Oxide, for example:
Our rigor means we enjoy and take pride in the craft of engineering.
Our urgency means that we are not above the judicious short-cut.
Our versatility is reflected in our greatest strength: the breadth of our team.
Our transparency can be seen in our consensus-driven RFD process.
Our responsibility means that we both lead and follow: we have our own domains, but we also help others on their parts.
Our curiosity shows in our insatiable desire to learn – and our empathy in our love of teaching others.
Our humor is a big part of our daily lives: we are inveterate wise-crackers whose video meetings spill into simultaneous text chat.
Our values also manifest themselves in our benefits:
Everyone makes $180,250, regardless of location.
We offer the best health insurance we could find: medical PPO plan, dental, and vision that are 100% covered for both employees and dependents.
We are very supportive of remote work. About half of our team is outside of the San Francisco Bay Area; our only requirement is working hours with a significant overlap with Pacific Time.
Our families and lives outside of our jobs are very important to us; our schedules are flexible to reflect and support that.",https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=535ad03217428130&fccid=78fc32d909bd4f0b&vjs=3,Big Data Software Engineer

Slack is looking for Backend Engineers to build features, design and implement API methods, and improve the performance and reliability of our systems as we rapidly scale our product and organization.We have backend engineers in almost every team across Slack, and in that role, you'll be making some of the most significant decisions for the team

.
We build our app using reliable tools that our team knows and trusts, including PHP/Hack, Java, MySQL, and Linux. Expertise in these areas is a huge plus, but having familiarity with other common web languages (such as Python or Ruby) and other relational databases are fine substitutes. We're a collaborative team who genuinely enjoys working together with a cross-functional team of product managers, designers, frontend, iOS, Android, automation, and quality engineers to make Slack a better product. We are looking for engineers that understand that simplicity and reliability are aspects of a system to be carefully calculated with every decision made.
What you will be doing
You'll brainstorm with Product Managers, Designers and Frontend Engineers to conceptualize and build new features for our large (and growing!) user base.
You'll produce high-quality results by leading or contributing heavily to large cross-functional projects that have a significant impact on the business.
You'll actively own features or systems and define their long-term health, while also improving the health of surrounding systems.
You'll assist our skilled support team and operations team in triaging and resolving production issues.
You'll mentor other engineers and deeply review code.
You'll improve engineering standards, tooling, and processes
What you should have
You've been building web applications professionally for 1-15+ years.
You have experience with functional or imperative programming languages - e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, C, or Java.
You can lead technical architecture discussions and help drive technical decisions within your team.
You write understandable, testable code with an eye towards maintainability.
You are a strong communicator. Explaining complex technical concepts to designers, support, and other engineers is no problem for you.
You possess strong computer science fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, programming languages, distributed systems, and information retrieval.
You have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering or related field, or equivalent training, fellowship, or work experience.

For Colorado-based roles: Minimum annual salary of $82,000-$230,000. You may also be entitled to receive bonus, restricted stock units, and benefits.

Netflix shows are produced and acquired all over the world and watched by more than 200 million accounts globally. In the Netflix Studio, we aim to give content creators the opportunity to bring their most visionary ideas to life and create joy for our members around the world through innovative storytelling.
The Content Finance Data Science & Engineering team at Netflix is a talented group of cross-functional data professionals. We help scale our rapidly growing Content & Studio efforts by focusing on datasets describing production cost, slate financial planning, and our global workforce of vendors and production talent. These data sets represent tens of billions of dollars - a large portion of Netflix’s revenue - reinvested into entertaining the world with original and acquired content. We conduct statistical analyses, develop analytic tools, develop new data sets and pipelines, and build predictive models and algorithms using machine learning, all with the goal of producing the best content we can in the best way we can. Check out this blog post to learn more about the area and some of the problems we're working on.
We’re looking for a Senior Data Engineer to help us architect, source, and build these foundational data sets into a rich, detailed playground for both our own team members and the hundreds of Content & Studio colleagues we partner with. We’ve only just started down this path. This is an opportunity to shape a high-impact data space at Netflix from its early stages.
In this role, you will:
Architect, strengthen, and expand the core data models that our Content and Studio functions use to answer business questions and evaluate their financial decisions. You’ll get to envision how all the data elements from multiple sources should fit together as a whole, and then execute on that plan
Partner with Analytics Engineers, Software Engineers, and business teams to create data sets that will serve analysis and reporting needs intuitively
Help craft the backend data layer of prototype applications or microservices used for reporting and analytic workflows
Source data from new Content and Studio systems or from rich unstructured records that are waiting to be structured!
Develop best practices for governance of data sets with sensitive information
About you:
Hands-on experience building production data pipelines, ideally using one or more distributed processing frameworks such as Spark or Hive/Hadoop
Expertise in data modeling and establishing data architecture across multiple systems
Proficiency in Python, or willingness to grow into Python from your other scripting languages (i.e., Java, Scala)
Comfort working with - and learning - a variety of tech stacks
Experience ingesting and managing data sets that are messy or incomplete at source
Strong communication; able to own and deepen direct relationships with our Engineering, Product Management, and business partners
Enthusiasm about innovating and learning in a fast paced environment
Comfort with ambiguity; able to thrive with minimal oversight and process
Culture
You will have the opportunity to impact the business in a meaningful way. You will have the freedom to innovate, solve interesting problems and influence in a fast paced, exciting environment. You will work with stunning colleagues who love to solve hard problems, and who not only expect but also foster high performance. You can learn more about the Netflix culture at jobs.netflix.com/culture.

"Software Engineer, New Graduate",Benchling,"San Francisco, CA 94103 (South of Market area)•Temporarily Remote",,"Over the coming years, biotech will fundamentally rewrite the way we live. Gene editing and cell therapy are dramatically changing how we treat cancer and other major illnesses. Biofuels and biomaterials are transforming the cars we drive, the clothes we wear, and the makeup of everyday objects. Crop science and synthetic biology are producing sustainable and ethical food. Benchling’s mission is to accelerate the research that propels us towards this reality, and magnify its impact, through modern software.

Every day, scientists around the world use Benchling’s applications, platform, & analytics in their efforts to solve humanity’s most pressing problems. For these scientists, Benchling is the central technology they use to conduct their research. Our customers include pharmaceutical giants, leading biotechs, and the world’s most renowned research institutes.
RESPONSIBILITIES

Work with and learn from a strong team of engineers. We grow our new grads through mentorship and ownership.
Own projects end-to-end, from initial design, to prototype, to large-scale rollout. You might:
Design and implement backend models and API endpoints for complex scientific workflows.
Design and implement rich frontend components and architecture. We build and operate one of the largest, richest React applications out there and power complex scientific analyses.
Design and build a platform framework or infrastructure tool for other Benchling engineers to use.
Work closely with product managers, designers, marketing, and sales to ensure that we’re building the right thing.
Help rapidly scale our product and team. As a member of the engineering team, you'll be an integral part of how we mature our tooling, best practices, engineering processes, and hiring.

YOU

Recently obtained or are pursuing a BA/BS and/or MA/MS degree in computer science, math or a related technical field.
Have had a prior Software Engineer Internship or similar experience.
Build software with a product-first approach. You ship code quickly and care about the real world impact of your code.
Have strong abilities in problem solving and iterating on feedback.
Enjoy ownership and building key pieces of product and/or platform.
Are interested in learning about life science, but prior knowledge is not required!

YOU MIGHT WORK ON
Check out our engineering blog for some examples of past work. Here are some other examples of recent and future projects:

Tools to simulate DNA assembly - computers can assist scientists by informing scientific decisions with complex calculations. Our bulk assembly tool allows scientists to simulate constructing hundreds of DNA constructs in parallel, visualizing the end result and highlighting potential issues.
Complex querying and visualization tools - The big advantage of keeping all your data stored in one system is that you can query that data all at once, without digging up multiple sources. This works best when you can query Benchling the same way you can query a database: by choosing from a large number of possible filters on any related objects, joining together various sources, and performing aggregations. We want to enable this in a user-friendly experience, without leaving your browser.
A customizable computation platform - Biologics are typically large protein complexes composed of a number of shared parts. We want to let scientists specify computations that can aggregate data across all of these related entities to surface derived values, which can be used in everything from data analysis to naming schemes. Scientists may develop custom protein analysis algorithms or proprietary validation logic - they'll be able to hook in custom code and push that computation to Benchling.
A new permissions system - Our existing permission system relies on Read/Write/Admin access that can only be applied at the top level of the file hierarchy. To roll out to enterprises with 500+ users, we need to offer them fine-grained control around exactly what actions a user can take and let them manage these in a hierarchical fashion.

Benchling welcomes everyone. We believe every member of our team enriches our diversity and inclusion by broadening our ways of problem-solving for future challenges. Even if you don't meet 100% of the qualifications for this job, we strongly encourage you to apply.

Staff Software Engineer,Pathstream,California•Remote,"$165,000 a year","Pathstream | Remote (or San Francisco, CA)

Imagine building the technology that provides career mobility for underserved adults. Pathstream is an online learning platform that materially helps people improve their careers and feed their families. Working in tech gives us incredible leverage but all too often our roles don't provide opportunities to apply that leverage in such a measurably impactful way. Where others have shied away from the challenges of tackling social inequities we've made it the center of our work and culture.

Why this role?

Build a platform that has a meaningful impact. Education is an uneven playing field and higher education fails many of the people who need it most. Pathstream teaches practical, employable skills to adult learners to get them their first $50K/year job. This is only possible with cutting edge software leveraging thoughtful, talented human instructors.

Have an outsize impact which extends to the broader org. Your role will impact not only your team, but other teams and departments. You will help design, build, and maintain the systems that anticipate and deliver on the needs of all stakeholders: our students, our curriculum development team, our instructors, and our operations staff.

Accelerate engineering. This role will be uniquely positioned to elevate an already high-performing engineering team by lending experience and perspective in a psychologically safe environment. Through mentorship and technical leadership you will improve individual and team growth as a core part of your output.

Grow with a team that values diversity, equity, and inclusion. Equity and inclusion are prerequisites for healthy decision making. At Pathstream, issues of diversity and justice aren't external social questions or touchy-feely extracurriculars – we know that the only place to do amazing work is on a level playing field. This is why fairness, transparent decision making, transparent policies, and a culture of revisiting and interrogating our own perspectives is a core part of how we do software engineering.

What will you do as a Staff Engineer at Pathstream?
Help build the technology that creates a more equitable path to upward mobility
Iterate on and help streamline engineering process within and beyond engineering
Support your engineering teammates through hands-on mentorship
Collaboratively design work that minimizes technical debt and increases team efficiency
Share your knowledge with your team by demonstrating and documenting technical leadership
Help shepherd the engineering team to stronger technical foundations
You might be a good fit if you have some of the following:
Very high proficiency in at least one of: Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, or Python
Very high proficiency with cloud providers such as: AWS, GCP, or Azure
Previous experience taking prototypical technical work and elevating it to a production-ready state in a short amount of time
Previous experience successfully driving technical decisioning across teams and departments
A love for building data intensive systems that scale
A proclivity for hard problems and excitement for collaboratively building solutions with a cross-functional team
A strong desire to work in high-trust environments that move quickly
Company Mission

Give people the path to a good career.

We have teachers who support classes of students and our online learning platform combines text, video, and interactive hands-on labs. Our courses teach advanced concepts like Tableau, Data Analytics, and Unity to students who are new to these skills.

About Engineering

We believe in working collaboratively, doing work at very high quality and centering our own professional growth in the work. We hire people who have additive strengths. It's okay to be bad at lots of things as long as somebody else on the team is good at them.

We don't ask algorithm interview questions. We do ask questions that relate to the job.

This is a full-time position which can be remote or based at Pathstream's headquarters in downtown San Francisco, CA once it is safe to return to in-person work. The team includes people all over the globe – including Palestine and Brazil – so it doesn't matter where you are so long as you can be available for work meetings between 9:30am and 1:00pm PST

What We Offer
Transparent and social culture, challenging work, fast learning cycles, practical training, and meaningful feedback
Competitive salary commensurate with experience
Minimum salary of $165,000/year + equity + benefits
Comprehensive benefits package
Medical, dental, and vision insurance coverage for you and your dependents
Health, commuter, and parking flexible spending accounts
Paid time off and paid holidays
Disability insurance

COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

Our company values diversity and believes diverse teams make innovation possible. We work on complex, difficult problems with no linear or clear solutions. We need a diverse team that can bring different perspectives and approaches, and whose experiences reflect the full set of stakeholders we seek to serve. As such, Pathstream is an equal opportunity employer. We encourage all qualified applicants from any race, color, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, disability status, protected veteran status, or other characteristics to apply.

Staff Software Engineer,Indeed,Remote,"$159,000 - $231,000 a year","Pathstream | Remote (or San Francisco, CA)

Imagine building the technology that provides career mobility for underserved adults. Pathstream is an online learning platform that materially helps people improve their careers and feed their families. Working in tech gives us incredible leverage but all too often our roles don't provide opportunities to apply that leverage in such a measurably impactful way. Where others have shied away from the challenges of tackling social inequities we've made it the center of our work and culture.

Why this role?

Build a platform that has a meaningful impact. Education is an uneven playing field and higher education fails many of the people who need it most. Pathstream teaches practical, employable skills to adult learners to get them their first $50K/year job. This is only possible with cutting edge software leveraging thoughtful, talented human instructors.

Have an outsize impact which extends to the broader org. Your role will impact not only your team, but other teams and departments. You will help design, build, and maintain the systems that anticipate and deliver on the needs of all stakeholders: our students, our curriculum development team, our instructors, and our operations staff.

Accelerate engineering. This role will be uniquely positioned to elevate an already high-performing engineering team by lending experience and perspective in a psychologically safe environment. Through mentorship and technical leadership you will improve individual and team growth as a core part of your output.

Grow with a team that values diversity, equity, and inclusion. Equity and inclusion are prerequisites for healthy decision making. At Pathstream, issues of diversity and justice aren't external social questions or touchy-feely extracurriculars – we know that the only place to do amazing work is on a level playing field. This is why fairness, transparent decision making, transparent policies, and a culture of revisiting and interrogating our own perspectives is a core part of how we do software engineering.

What will you do as a Staff Engineer at Pathstream?
Help build the technology that creates a more equitable path to upward mobility
Iterate on and help streamline engineering process within and beyond engineering
Support your engineering teammates through hands-on mentorship
Collaboratively design work that minimizes technical debt and increases team efficiency
Share your knowledge with your team by demonstrating and documenting technical leadership
Help shepherd the engineering team to stronger technical foundations
You might be a good fit if you have some of the following:
Very high proficiency in at least one of: Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, or Python
Very high proficiency with cloud providers such as: AWS, GCP, or Azure
Previous experience taking prototypical technical work and elevating it to a production-ready state in a short amount of time
Previous experience successfully driving technical decisioning across teams and departments
A love for building data intensive systems that scale
A proclivity for hard problems and excitement for collaboratively building solutions with a cross-functional team
A strong desire to work in high-trust environments that move quickly
Company Mission

Give people the path to a good career.

We have teachers who support classes of students and our online learning platform combines text, video, and interactive hands-on labs. Our courses teach advanced concepts like Tableau, Data Analytics, and Unity to students who are new to these skills.

About Engineering

We believe in working collaboratively, doing work at very high quality and centering our own professional growth in the work. We hire people who have additive strengths. It's okay to be bad at lots of things as long as somebody else on the team is good at them.

We don't ask algorithm interview questions. We do ask questions that relate to the job.

This is a full-time position which can be remote or based at Pathstream's headquarters in downtown San Francisco, CA once it is safe to return to in-person work. The team includes people all over the globe – including Palestine and Brazil – so it doesn't matter where you are so long as you can be available for work meetings between 9:30am and 1:00pm PST

What We Offer
Transparent and social culture, challenging work, fast learning cycles, practical training, and meaningful feedback
Competitive salary commensurate with experience
Minimum salary of $165,000/year + equity + benefits
Comprehensive benefits package
Medical, dental, and vision insurance coverage for you and your dependents
Health, commuter, and parking flexible spending accounts
Paid time off and paid holidays
Disability insurance
Life insurance
401(k)

COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

Our company values diversity and believes diverse teams make innovation possible. We work on complex, difficult problems with no linear or clear solutions. We need a diverse team that can bring different perspectives and approaches, and whose experiences reflect the full set of stakeholders we seek to serve. As such, Pathstream is an equal opportunity employer. We encourage all qualified applicants from any race, color, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, disability status, protected veteran status, or other characteristics to apply.

"Software Engineer, Marketplace Trading",Indigo,"Boston, MA•Remote",,"As a backend engineer on the Marketplace Trading team, you’ll create scalable, distributed systems that integrate with a rich ecosystem of services to power web, mobile, and desktop applications empowering thousands of farmers throughout the world to sustainably feed the planet. Particular to the Trading team, you’ll be responsible for building fast, secure, reliable, testable, audited integrations with financial providers to perform commodities hedging on behalf of our customers.

Indigo Marketplace is changing how food is produced and sold—in the U.S. now, and soon around the world. Today, growers don’t have incentive to grow higher-quality crops. In fact, since grain is commoditized, growers’ main incentive is to simply grow as much volume as possible.

Our Marketplace flips the current model on its head by connecting growers directly with buyers and preserving crop identity. This means that growers get paid a premium for growing organic and similarly desirable crops.

Your expertise in software interface design and architecture will help us deliver a flexible backend to our growing suite of world-class marketplace products.

As an engineer at Indigo you’ll:

Lead features end to end, from design to implementation to deployment to production support, communicating risks and issues to stakeholders, and working together to find a path forward
Help design and implement performant APIs using a modern web stack consisting of Python, FastAPI, and Poetry.
Collaborate with product managers, front-end engineers, and data science engineers to spec, build, test and deploy high quality code in the cloud
Leverage applicable design patterns, refactoring code where necessary, to maintain organizational consistency
Ensure that all APIs are adequately tested in an automated framework, including functional and performance tests
Review code, have your code reviewed, and learn from other engineers
Voice your expertise to provide technical constraints and solutions to product managers, with a focus on incremental delivery

About You

You have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field, or equivalent work experience or training (ie professional bootcamps)
You’ve been building web applications professionally for 2+ years with a focus on backend work
You possess strong computer science fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, programming languages, distributed systems, and data management
You have experience in one or more imperative programming languages
You’ve worked in systems that have specific security, privacy, and/or auditability requirements
You possess a good understanding of the web request/response lifecycle and API design - including versioning, isolation and microservice architectures
You have experience deploying and monitoring software in a cloud provider such as AWS, Azure or GCP
You have built production applications using one or more of the following, or similar: Python, Node.js, Ruby.
You understand how to design APIs and libraries that are easy for clients to use, while protecting the SLAs of the backend systems
You’re able to research and propose new technologies or software patterns to improve the software ecosystem
You’re a strong communicator that can convey technical concepts and trade-offs to both engineering and business audiences
You have prior experience working in a fast-paced, agile environment
You bring a positive attitude, a sense of humor, and self awareness
You are a perpetual learner and passionate about technology
About Indigo:

We’re building the technology to feed the world and fight climate change. We believe that through teamwork we can achieve more to benefit all of agriculture: from farmers to consumers to the planet.

Game changers don't fit in a box. The requirements listed above are examples of what we think enables success in this role, but we recognize the impossibility of fully capturing a singularly perfect description, and we believe in the power of diversified and creative displays of skills and qualifications.

The product engineering team works in a highly collaborative environment with the business stakeholders, directly negotiating requirements without the added layer of a formalized product or program management department. Engineers join JetFuel for the focus on product, the ability to ship lots of products, fast, and the no-ego, level-disregarding collaboration that is fostered across the entire company.

How We Work
Freedom and Flexibility: At Loom, we believe work is an act, not a place. When we disengage work from a location, we can accommodate a broad range of life choices. You can choose to work from home or while you travel. If you are in the Bay Area, you can drop by our San Francisco office on 2nd and Market St. when reopens in Fall 2021. We are able to hire across the United States and Canada* and are continuing to expand our international presence. And you are free to move within a country without any adjustment to compensation.
Engaging Workday: The key to an engaging workday is finding the right balance between different ways to work sync, async, text and video. Loom makes it easier for us to say what we mean without having to schedule a zoom meeting or struggle to find the right words. And using async communication allows us to free up time for deep work every day. We believe there's a place for sync time - often a conversation on Zoom is exactly what is needed. For team meetings, this ‘sync time’ is typically between 9AM-Noon PT given where the overlap of timezones where Loommates are located.
Work-Rest Balance: The way we balance the fast-paced demands of a high-growth startup and sustainability is making rest a priority. We offer a flexible PTO policy so you're able to take time off when you need it. We also go fully offline once a year between Christmas and New Year (and twice during the Pandemic). Rest is also part of the workday, not just during PTO. Taking a break for personal commitments, whether it's watching the kids or getting some exercise is natural part of the workday.
Social Connection: Relationships and connectedness matter. We are intentional about building trust and relationships through unique, shared experiences. Our virtual workspace keeps us connected day-to-day whether it's through Looms celebrating wins or our buzzing Slack communities. Post-COVID, we want Loommates to meet in person at least twice a year purely for fun. We're also experimenting in local offices as social spaces, starting with San Francisco in Fall 2021.

About Netflix:
Netflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service, with 200+ million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause, and resume watching all without commercials or commitments. We are revolutionizing how shows and movies are produced, pushing technological boundaries to efficiently deliver streaming video at a massive scale over the internet. We are focused on disrupting the media and entertainment industry by applying innovative software development and data design practices.
The team:
We enable Netflix to create, transfer and store content at the exabyte scale. As our studio grows, and we continue to make content, our storage systems need to meet those demands. If we shoot in LA, editorial might happen in Vancouver, and other post-production functions could happen in Mumbai. The files need to be able to transfer from one location to another. Currently, the way the industry moves files is physical. What we are doing is similar to what email did to the paper and pen. We are putting everything into the cloud and moving large amounts of data in near real-time. What takes other studios weeks to months to complete, takes us just days. As we continue to innovate in this space, we will get closer and closer to real time, which will further enable our goal of creating content that brings our members joy. This team is at the heart of that initiative and without us, it would be impossible to meet that goal. This platform works in various infrastructure locations, not just AWS, but our own infra like Open connect. We are building storage services to support the vast amount of data and metadata that we ingest, curate, and manage. We are focusing on building value-add data services on top of open platforms. This platform is a foundational building block to multiple studio technology products that will change the way the entertainment industry makes and produces content.
The Role
We are looking for a senior software engineer with relevant experience for the storage platform team. As a key member of this team you will have an opportunity to work on multiple layers of the storage platform stack which include block and object storage via Ceph, transfer plane to move large files efficiently and reliably across different locations, sophisticated control plane that stores metadata and orchestrates the storage platform by integrating with various applications and a file system in user space interface for workstations . This is a cross-functional role where you will partner, collaborate and align with engineering, product and business teams across platform and studio organizations. The scope and impact of the team are rapidly evolving and growing which will provide opportunities to evolve and grow in innovative ways.
Who Are You?
You are curious, enjoy hard technical problems, and are driven by big impact.
You enjoy collaborating across cross-functional teams and connecting the dots.
You are a clear, proactive communicator with good written and verbal skills.
You build trust and are capable of debating and understanding different perspectives but always be driven by making the right decisions for the business.
You have a track record of strong technical architecture, product vision, project execution and production operations.
What (ideally) you already know or have experience in
Storage technologies like FUSE (File system in user space), File systems, Block storage, Object storage.
Platform development and operational experience in cloud infrastructures.
Delivered cross-functional complex products across multiple teams.
Working through quickly evolving business requirements and multiple stakeholders.
We are inclusive and our culture is unique. We tend to live by our values, so it’s worth learning more about Netflix here.

If you want to get ahead of it all, you’ve got to think bigger, see farther, and act sooner. That’s the Everstream Analytics approach. Through our unique capabilities, companies like Google, Schneider Electric, Unilever, and Campbell’s can grow and protect more revenue.

Resilience360 was incubated in DHL’s Global Innovation Center in 2012 following global catastrophes in 2011 to help DHL’s clients be better prepared for and responsive to supply chain disruptions and has grown into the leading supply chain risk management platform.
In 2018 Columbia capital committed $21 million to the growth of Resilience360 through organic growth and acquisitions and in 2019 led the acquisition of Riskpulse with Greenspring Associates joining the associated funding round. DHL remains a major shareholder.

What Makes Cloudflare Special?

We're not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We're a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare's enterprise customers-at no cost.

Athenian Project: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

Sound like something you'd like to be a part of? We'd love to hear from you!

Software Engineer: Embedded Systems,Oxide Computer Company,Remote,"$180,250 a year","The rack-scale computer is loaded with essential embedded systems, responsible for the many unseen components that support the operation of a rack-scale computer.
As a software engineer working on embedded systems software, you will:
Work with a friendly and positive team to write the low-level code that makes Oxide computers tick.
Write code mostly in Rust, read code primarily written in Rust and C. The vast majority of code you write will be open source (maybe all of it!), and we are not starting with existing vendor code – we’re trying to do things right.
Write programs that interact with the physical world, from blinking lights to rack-level thermal control systems to supporting hot-swap of server components.
Read datasheets for relevant sensors, microcontrollers, etc., and implement drivers for them in bare-metal and embedded RTOS environments.
Drive our device security by extending the verified boot chain from first instruction to the control plane running on Oxide systems. You’ll secure the interface among lowest level components and into the control plane, build identity and access control, and work with the team to define and defend against threats.
Code without fear, supported by continuous builds, unit testing, memory-safe code, good debugging tools, a constructive code-review process, and a supportive culture of identifying and fixing bugs.
These responsibilities are just a starting place! We’re a small company, we don’t have rigid roles, and we have a lot to do – we can help you grow wherever your interests take you.
You will thrive in this role if you:
Have previously worked with Rust or another low-level systems language such as C.
Have worked with microcontrollers, whether it’s at a job or some kind of Arduino pet-washing coffee maker.
Believe in fully documenting your ideas.
Enjoy reading the documentation produced by others.
Get excited about things and dig really deep into them.
Are very comfortable at a Unix terminal.
Don’t mind coworkers getting really excited about decades-old computer front panels.
If you don’t meet 100% of these qualifications you should still seriously consider applying – at least one of us was missing each of these at the outset!
Life at Oxide
We are very explicit about our values, and they can be seen in daily life at Oxide, for example:
Our rigor means we enjoy and take pride in the craft of engineering.
Our urgency means that we are not above the judicious short-cut.
Our versatility is reflected in our greatest strength: the breadth of our team.
Our transparency can be seen in our consensus-driven RFD process.
Our responsibility means that we both lead and follow: we have our own domains, but we also help others on their parts.
Our curiosity shows in our insatiable desire to learn – and our empathy in our love of teaching others.
Our humor is a big part of our daily lives: we are inveterate wise-crackers whose video meetings spill into simultaneous text chat.
Our values also manifest themselves in our benefits:
Everyone makes $180,250, regardless of location.
We offer the best health insurance we could find: medical PPO plan, dental, and vision that are 100% covered for both employees and dependents.
We are very supportive of remote work. About half of our team is outside of the San Francisco Bay Area; our only requirement is working hours with a significant overlap with Pacific Time.
Our families and lives outside of our jobs are very important to us; our schedules are flexible to reflect and support that.",https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=535ad03217428130&fccid=78fc32d909bd4f0b&vjs=3,Big Data Software Engineer

At Cloudflare, we have our eyes set on an ambitious goal: to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world's largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine's Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World's Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.

We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!

About the Distributed Web team

The Distributed Web team maintains Cloudflare's InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Ethereum Gateways. The IPFS Gateway lets users access content stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) quickly and easily, without downloading any special software or giving up any storage space on their computer. Similarly, Cloudflare's Ethereum Gateway lets users interact with the Ethereum network without installing any software on their computer.

Responsibilities

Cloudflare Distributed Web Gateway provides an HTTP interface to the Distributed Web. Leveraging Cloudflare infrastructure, websites can easily and securely retrieve data from Ethereum or IPFS. In this role, you can expect to face challenges in providing distributed systems at scale, operating active open source projects, as well as operating at the Edge.

These projects are written in Go and TypeScript, and run in a Kubernetes environment. Along with the rest of the team, you will own and support the whole stack: the code base, deployment and rollback plans, operations, monitoring, alerting and debugging. You may contribute to open source projects, and see your code be served at scale.

Example of desirable skills, knowledge, and experience

The person we are looking for is someone who has or can demonstrate the following attributes:

Can chase problems through multiple layers of our software stack. You can be flexible and you are very curious.
Flexible and very autonomous. You won't be micromanaged in this role and will be looked to for thinking out of the box and coming up with simple and smart design for complex issues.
Care about writing robust systems, code quality, performance and technical debt. You understand the trade offs that doing rigorous engineering requires.
Worked on storage systems, peer to peer systems, distributed systems or simply system programming in general.
Pragmatic and believe in the value of design elegance - a simple solution is often better than a more complex one.
Does low-level and high-level programming.
You enjoy being a part of a team that critiques each others' designs - you are good at taking and giving constructive criticism with a goal of producing the best solution.

What Makes Cloudflare Special?

We're not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We're a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare's enterprise customers-at no cost.

Athenian Project: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

"Associate, Software Engineer",Stash,New York State•Remote,,"Want to help everyday Americans invest and build wealth? Financial inequality is increasing, and too many people are getting left behind. At Stash, we are passionate about democratizing wealth creation through education, advice, and products that help customers achieve greater financial freedom.

Our team is looking for Junior Engineers with a passion for learning and contributing to the reliable, scalable, and performant software that powers the Stash experience.

We have multiple roles available on different teams, including Android Engineer, Backend Engineer, Full Stack Engineer, iOS Engineer, and Web Engineer. The Junior Engineer role will report to the Engineering Manager of the team.

There are three different front-end applications that Stash customers can choose from when accessing all the functionality that Stash has to offer: an Android application written in Kotlin, an iOS application written in Swift, and a Web application written in JavaScript using React.

At Stash we use a variety of different languages, frameworks, tools, and vendors to accomplish our goals. We use the right tool for the job when it comes to reaching for tech that will solve whatever challenge we're facing. Stronger versus more relaxed type system and type checking, functional versus procedural programming, etc. We make deliberate decisions that we feel will help our platform grow and mature and support more and more customers.

Our technology stack features languages like Ruby, Scala, JavaScript, Swift, Kotlin, and Lua. Hand in hand with Ruby is the Rails framework which has allowed us to move quickly in both the early days and with a lot of the newer things we are currently building. We write a lot of backend code in Scala - for these projects we like to leverage Akka HTTP. Most of the time we reach for a relational database like Postgres to store data, and we rely upon Redis as a cache. We're big fans of Terraform and Kubernetes, too.

We hire the best engineers regardless of programming language or background. We have invested (and continue to invest in) our onboarding process so even if you join with no Scala experience, you'll have the time and space to learn. We consider Stash a learning organization and work hard to allow Engineers the time and the space to learn and grow. We encourage tech experimentation and continuous improvement.

We've had tremendous growth in the past few years and have an exciting product roadmap ahead of us.

If you're interested in solving complex problems associated with scaling a popular consumer facing application and working in an open, diverse, and inclusive environment, Stash might be the fit for you!

What you'll do:

Work in a multi-functional agile team to produce working software incrementally
Instrument, test, profile, and code review software

What we're looking for:

Interest in building consumer-facing software
A passionate engineer willing and able to learn new languages
Creative problem solver with a passion for testing, debugging, and overall code quality
Familiarity with or interest in technologies we use

At Stash it is our mission to help everyday Americans invest and build wealth. That includes people of all races, genders, and abilities, so it is important to us to acknowledge and address the issues of inequality in financial services head on.

Diversity and inclusion are essential to living our values, promoting innovation, and building the best products. Our success is directly related to our employees and we believe that our team should reflect the diversity of the customers that we serve. As an Equal Opportunity Employer, Stash is committed to building an inclusive environment for people of all backgrounds.

Engineers join JetFuel for the focus on product, the ability to ship lots of products, fast, and the no-ego, level-disregarding collaboration that is fostered across the entire company.

Locations: Hiring Remotely within the continental US (hub cities are: Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Austin, Madison)

Take the first step to prepare for a career as a software developer at 8th Light.

About Us

Do you want an opportunity to work with top companies solving interesting business challenges through technology? Do you want a job where you will face new challenges every single day and have continual opportunities to learn and teach while being surrounded by enthusiastic and energizing coworkers? Do you want to work in a supportive environment where curiosity is rewarded? Then talk to us!

As an employee-owned software consultancy, we consider software development a craft. Our team of expert developers and designers hold the title of ""Crafter"" to reflect our dedication to quality, our emphasis on continual learning, and our belief that software is truly a craft—something that we take pride in, and value highly. We value colleagues who enjoy learning and teaching, which creates our collaborative organization.

About Our Paid Apprenticeship

We know that getting that first software job can be tough. Many organizations require you to have years of experience or a computer science degree for that first role. At 8th Light, we invest in people even if you haven't had the chance yet to extensively demonstrate and grow your software skills.

Our paid apprenticeship is a focused period of learning centered around becoming a disciplined, skilled, well-rounded software crafter capable of delivering high-quality software and consulting to our clients.

Under the guidance of a team of experienced mentors, apprentices will embark on a process designed to hone their programming, client service, collaboration, leadership and communication skills. They learn on their own while committing to, and completing a variety of projects in different languages. They learn to lead by example, provide and receive honest feedback and answer the questions a client might not ask.

Towards the end of the apprenticeship, apprentices spend time shadowing and pairing with 8th Light crafters on client projects. The apprenticeship ends with a demonstration of their work that is evaluated by a review board of 8th Light crafters.

Applicants

You've built software before, maybe not in a professional setting, but you're an avid learner and are highly driven to improve your skills. Successful applicants generally have:

An understanding of at least one programming language.
A basic understanding of Test-Driven Development.
Professional working experience (not necessarily in software).
Expectations of a Crafter

Upon successful completion of your apprenticeship, you'll join 8th Light's team of developers and designers as a Crafter. In this role, you will:

Pair and collaborate with teammates to deliver quality software.
Mentor apprentices and client employees based on 8th Light best practices.
Work with clients to report progress and plan future projects.
About 8th Light

We recognize that creating a truly diverse, equitable, and inclusive organization is an ongoing journey, and we're excited to share our journey with you. We have a proud tradition of hiring talented colleagues with unusual career experiences. We're more interested in your experiences, your story and their resulting impact than recognized schools, degrees, or keywords that may appear on your resume.

8th Light is a remote-friendly organization.

8th Light is committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity, or Veteran status.

"Associate, Software Engineer",Stash,New York State•Remote,,"Want to help everyday Americans invest and build wealth? Financial inequality is increasing, and too many people are getting left behind. At Stash, we are passionate about democratizing wealth creation through education, advice, and products that help customers achieve greater financial freedom.

Our team is looking for Junior Engineers with a passion for learning and contributing to the reliable, scalable, and performant software that powers the Stash experience.

We have multiple roles available on different teams, including Android Engineer, Backend Engineer, Full Stack Engineer, iOS Engineer, and Web Engineer. The Junior Engineer role will report to the Engineering Manager of the team.

There are three different front-end applications that Stash customers can choose from when accessing all the functionality that Stash has to offer: an Android application written in Kotlin, an iOS application written in Swift, and a Web application written in JavaScript using React.

At Stash we use a variety of different languages, frameworks, tools, and vendors to accomplish our goals. We use the right tool for the job when it comes to reaching for tech that will solve whatever challenge we're facing. Stronger versus more relaxed type system and type checking, functional versus procedural programming, etc. We make deliberate decisions that we feel will help our platform grow and mature and support more and more customers.

Our technology stack features languages like Ruby, Scala, JavaScript, Swift, Kotlin, and Lua. Hand in hand with Ruby is the Rails framework which has allowed us to move quickly in both the early days and with a lot of the newer things we are currently building. We write a lot of backend code in Scala - for these projects we like to leverage Akka HTTP. Most of the time we reach for a relational database like Postgres to store data, and we rely upon Redis as a cache. We're big fans of Terraform and Kubernetes, too.

We hire the best engineers regardless of programming language or background. We have invested (and continue to invest in) our onboarding process so even if you join with no Scala experience, you'll have the time and space to learn. We consider Stash a learning organization and work hard to allow Engineers the time and the space to learn and grow. We encourage tech experimentation and continuous improvement.

We've had tremendous growth in the past few years and have an exciting product roadmap ahead of us.

If you're interested in solving complex problems associated with scaling a popular consumer facing application and working in an open, diverse, and inclusive environment, Stash might be the fit for you!

What you'll do:

Work in a multi-functional agile team to produce working software incrementally
Instrument, test, profile, and code review software

What we're looking for:

Interest in building consumer-facing software
A passionate engineer willing and able to learn new languages
Creative problem solver with a passion for testing, debugging, and overall code quality
Familiarity with or interest in technologies we use

At Stash it is our mission to help everyday Americans invest and build wealth. That includes people of all races, genders, and abilities, so it is important to us to acknowledge and address the issues of inequality in financial services head on.

Diversity and inclusion are essential to living our values, promoting innovation, and building the best products. Our success is directly related to our employees and we believe that our team should reflect the diversity of the customers that we serve. As an Equal Opportunity Employer, Stash is committed to building an inclusive environment for people of all backgrounds.
